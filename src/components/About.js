          Musician.<br />

          Award-winning sound editor!<br />
          Mostly harmless.<br />
        </p>
        <p>After nearly 20 years working in sound &mdash; <br />
        editing sound for video games, films, &amp; television &mdash;<br />
        mixing live sound for theatre &amp; music &mdash;<br />
        &mdash;<br />
        I'm adding web development to that list.<br />
        12 weeks at the Iron Yard in Indianapolis has prepared me for a lifetime of learning to code,<br />
        because if I've learned one thing, it's that I haven't learned <em>anything</em> yet... in the grand scheme of things.
      </p>
      <p>However, I <em>have</em> learned that I can learn, and pretty fast, too.<br />
      HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript, with Node.js/Express, SQL(Postgres), MongoDB/Mongoose, &amp; React/React Native to round it all out.</p>
      <p>Like I said, what do <em>you</em> want to do today?</p>
